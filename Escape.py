#Escape Sequence Character
#To insert character that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an escape sequence character.
#An escape sequence is a backslash "\" followed by the character you want to insert
print("Hey I'm a \"good boy\" and this viewer is also a good girl/boy") #\" good boy\" is used to put double courts in your sentence!!

print("hey", 6, 7) #inside a single print statement I can peint multiple things
print("hey", 6, 7, sep="~") #If you want to seperate the statements using any sing just use sep="" and put that sign inside double courts

print("Hey", 6, 7, end="009") #end="" statement specifies what to print at the end, Default is '\n'
print("Harry")

print("Hey", 6, 7, end="009\n") #end can be used in both the ways 
print("Harry")
